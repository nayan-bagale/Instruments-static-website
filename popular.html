            <h2>Acoustic Guitar</h2>
            <img src="./img/Guitar.webp" alt="Acoustic Guitar">
            <p>The guitar is a string instrument which is played by plucking the strings. The main parts of a guitar are the body, the fretboard, the headstock and the strings. Guitars are usually made from wood or plastic. Their strings are made of steel or nylon.
                <br> guitar strings are plucked with the fingers and fingernails of the right hand (or left hand, for left handed players), or a small pick made of thin plastic. This type of pick is called a "plectrum" or guitar pick. The left hand holds the neck of the guitar while the fingers pluck the strings. Different finger positions on the fretboard make different notes.

                <span class ="more">Guitar-like plucked string instruments have been used for many years. In many countries and at many different time periods, guitars and other plucked string instruments have been very popular, because they are light to carry from place to place, they are easier to learn to play than many other instruments. Guitars are used for many types of music, from Classical to Rock. Most pieces of popular music that have been written since the 1950s are written with guitars.
                    <br><br>
                    There are many different types of guitars, classified on how they are made and the type of music they are used for. All traditional types of guitar have a body which is hollow. This makes the sound of the strings louder, and gives the guitar its quality. This type of guitar is called "acoustic". (An acoustic instrument is one that makes its own dynamics.)
                    <br><br>
                    From the 1930s, people started making and playing guitars that used electricity and amplifiers to control the loudness. These guitars, which are often used in popular music, are called electric guitars. They do not need to have a hollow body. This is because they do not use acoustics to amplify the sound.
                    <br><br>
                    Most guitars have six strings, but there are also guitars with four, seven, eight, ten, or twelve strings. More strings make the instrument sound fuller. The neck of a guitar has bars or marks called frets. Frets help a guitarist know where to put his or her fingers to get the right pitch when playing. Standard tuning defines the string pitches as E, A, D, G, B, and E, from lowest (low E2) to highest (high E4). Standard tuning is used by most guitarists, and frequently used tunings can be understood as variations on standard tuning.

            <img src="./img/drums.jpg" alt="Drums">
            <p>A drum kit is a collection of drums and other percussion instruments. It is played by a single player with drumsticks. It has some feet operating pedals that control the hi-hat cymbal and the beater for the bass drum. The drum kit may be divided into four parts such as breakables(sticks, snare drum, etc), shells(bass drum, toms, etc), extensions, and hardware(drum stands, pedal, etc). The drum is an instrument that gives a living effect to the music so if you love playing drums then what are you waiting for. Your drum is in the list of those instruments that can provide you employment. So it’s time to follow your passion.</p>

            <p>Some experts separate the two, and they do have different uses, but the basics are very similar. Some instructors believe that learning to play piano should be a prerequisite for learning any other instrument. “Despite being a single instrument, a piano covers the full spectrum of any instrument featured in the orchestra,” according to the La Habra and Corona Music Centers. It teaches coordination between hands and between the hand and the eye.</p>
